## Relax-and-Recover Sponsoring

We need you - the community - for feedback to improve Relax-and-Recover features and quality in its whole. However, coding and testing cost time (lots of it) and we can spend more time if we are sponsored by you.

You can sponsor in many ways:

 - create [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
 - read, advise and improve the current documentation (with pull requests)
 - [donate an amount of money](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?item_name=Donation+to+Relax+and+Recover&cmd=_donations&business=gratien.dhaese%40gmail.com)
 - [professionally consultancy (onsite or remote)](http://relax-and-recover.org/development/)
 - [a ReaR subscription to foresee in continuous development](https://www.it3.be/rear-support/)
 - [sponsor the ReaR User Guide writing](https://www.it3.be/projects/rear-user-guide/)
 - [a support contract as insurance](https://www.it3.be/rear-support/)
 - [a workshop around ReaR](https://github.com/rear/rear-workshop)

### Wishlist of missing features

If you have a missing feature please first [submit an issue](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues). We are informed automatically and we will add it to this list. The community can select any missing feature and decide to sponsor it (via one of the above mentioned possibilities). When a missing feature has been added to this list we will close it. However, it will be re-opened by us when we have found a sponsor for it.
