   * restore via NFS4 Server running on rescue system

 * Two phase disk layout recovery, allows reconfiguration before recovery, e.g.
   * migrations from e.g. SWRAID to HWRAID, or unencryped to encrypted partitions
   * HWRAID reconfigurations
   * migration from partitions to LVM

 * Various techniques to help troubleshooting
   * structured log files and guided menus
   * log files are moved to recovery image, and to recovered system (available in every step for debugging)
   * advanced debugging options to help trace scripts or develop new functionality

 * Integration with monitoring (examples for Nagios/Opsview)

 * Integration with scheduler
   _(e.g. let cron recreate and transfer your images upon disk layout changes)_

 * Various best practices to assist recovery

   * integrates with local bootloader
     _(in case it is still possible, you can restore from local disk through Grub)_
   * automatic network and ssh configuration
     _(for remote recovery)_
   * automatic serial console support
     _(useful for recovery through iLO or KVM serial console)_
   * shell history-stuffing
     _(stuff shell history with useful commands at every step)_
   * automatic recovery when possible, guided recovery when needed
